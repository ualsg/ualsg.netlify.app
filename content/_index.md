        We are introducing innovative methods, datasets, and software to derive new insights in cities and advance data-driven urban planning, digital twins, and geospatial technologies in establishing and managing the smart cities of tomorrow. 

        Converging multidisciplinary approaches inspired by recent advancements in computer science, geomatics and urban data science, and influenced by crowdsourcing and open science, we conceive cutting-edge techniques for urban sensing and analytics at the city-scale.
