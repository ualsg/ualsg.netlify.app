Sifan is a PhD candidate in the School of Architecture, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), and a Computational Social Science Lab (CSSL) Fellowship recipient in the Faculty of Social Science, CUHK.
Her research interests focus on urban analytics, and employing multi-source open data to quantitatively characterize urban form, design, and planning characteristics, and their impact on residents’ perceptions and health outcomes.
She is now working on evaluating the perceived restoration and stress of the street-built environment in high-density city contexts, mainly integrating urban big data, including social media content and street view images.
She holds a bachelor's degree in Landscape Architecture from Beijing Forestry University and a master's degree in Urban Design from CUHK.
