Xiaobing is a PhD candidate at Ghent University, Belgium, with experience in GIS, Remote Sensing, and Cartography.
Her research focuses on refined urban modeling using street view images, particularly within the contexts of urban climate and mobility.
Her recent work involves extracting and mapping transportation-related infrastructures from street view images, with applications to support mobility analysis, such as cycling safety.
At UAL, Xiaobing will continue her work on GeoAI and built environment analysis to address challenges in urban sustainable mobility.
